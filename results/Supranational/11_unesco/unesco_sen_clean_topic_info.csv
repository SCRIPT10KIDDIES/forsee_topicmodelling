paris from to november at its session recognizing the profound and dynamic positive and negative impacts of artificial intelligence ai on societies environment ecosystems and human lives including the human mind in part because of the new ways in which its use influences human thinking interaction and and affects education human social and natural sciences culture and communication and information recalling that by the terms of its constitution unesco seeks to contribute to peace and security by promoting collaboration among nations through education the sciences culture and communication and information in order to further universal respect for justice for the rule of law and for the human rights and fundamental freedoms which are affirmed for the peoples of the world convinced that the recommendation presented here as instrument developed through global approach based on international law focusing on human dignity and human rights as well as gender equality social and economic justice and development physical and mental diversity interconnectedness inclusiveness and environmental and ecosystem protection can guide ai technologies in responsible direction guided by the purposes and principles of the charter of the united nations considering that ai technologies can be of great service to humanity and all countries can benefit from them but also raise fundamental ethical concerns for instance regarding the biases they can embed and exacerbate potentially resulting in discrimination inequality digital divides exclusion and threat to cultural social and biological diversity and social or economic divides the need for transparency and understandability of the workings of algorithms and the data with which they have been trained and their potential impact on including but not limited to human dignity human rights and fundamental freedoms gender equality democracy social economic political and cultural processes scientific and engineering practices animal welfare and the environment and ecosystems also recognizing that ai technologies can deepen existing divides and inequalities in the world within and between countries and that justice trust and fairness must be upheld so that no country and no one should be left behind either by having fair access to ai technologies and enjoying their benefits or in the protection against their negative implications while recognizing the different circumstances of different countries and respecting the desire of some people not to take part in all technological developments conscious of the fact that all countries are facing an acceleration in the use of information and communication technologies and ai technologies as well as an increasing need for media and information literacy and that the digital economy presents important societal economic and environmental challenges and opportunities of sharing especially for and countries lmics including but not limited to least developed countries ldcs landlocked developing countries lldcs and small island developing states sids requiring the recognition protection and promotion of endogenous cultures values and knowledge in order to develop sustainable digital economies further recognizing that ai technologies have the potential to be beneficial to the environment and ecosystems and in order for those benefits to be realized potential harms to and negative impacts on the environment and ecosystems should not be ignored but instead addressed noting that addressing risks and ethical concerns should not hamper innovation and development but rather provide new opportunities and stimulate research and innovation that anchor ai technologies in human rights and fundamental freedoms values and principles and moral and ethical reflection also recalling that in november the general conference of unesco at its session adopted resolution by which it mandated the to prepare an international instrument on the ethics of artificial intelligence ai in the form of recommendation which is to be submitted to the general conference at its session in recognizing that the development of ai technologies necessitates commensurate increase in data media and information literacy as well as access to independent pluralistic trusted sources of information including as part of efforts to mitigate risks of misinformation disinformation and hate speech and harm caused through the misuse of personal data observing that normative framework for ai technologies and its social implications finds its basis in international and national legal frameworks human rights and fundamental freedoms ethics need for access to data information and knowledge the freedom of research and innovation human and environmental and ecosystem and connects ethical values and principles to the challenges and opportunities linked to ai technologies based on common understanding and shared aims also recognizing that ethical values and principles can help develop and implement policy measures and legal norms by providing guidance with view to the fast pace of technological development also convinced that globally accepted ethical standards for ai technologies in full respect of international law in particular human rights law can play key role in developing norms across the globe bearing in mind the universal declaration of human rights the instruments of the international human rights framework including the convention relating to the status of refugees the discrimination employment and occupation convention the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination the international covenant on civil and political rights the international covenant on economic social

specific attention must be paid to lmics including but not limited to ldcs lldcs and sids as they have their own capacity but have been underrepresented in the ai ethics debate which raises concerns about neglecting local knowledge cultural pluralism value systems and the demands of global fairness to deal with the positive and negative impacts of ai technologies also conscious of the many existing national policies other frameworks and initiatives elaborated by relevant united nations entities intergovernmental organizations including regional organizations as well as those by the private sector professional organizations organizations and the scientific community related to the ethics and regulation of ai technologies further convinced that ai technologies can bring important benefits but that achieving them can also amplify tension around innovation asymmetric access to knowledge and technologies including the digital and civic literacy deficit that limits the public ability to engage in topics related to ai as well as barriers to access to information and gaps in capacity human and institutional capacities barriers to access to technological innovation and lack of adequate physical and digital infrastructure and regulatory frameworks including those related to data all of which need to be addressed underlining that the strengthening of global cooperation and solidarity including through multilateralism is needed to facilitate fair access to ai technologies and address the challenges that they bring to diversity and interconnectivity of cultures and ethical systems to mitigate potential misuse to realize the full potential that ai can bring especially in the area of development and to ensure that national ai strategies are guided by ethical principles taking fully into account that the rapid development of ai technologies challenges their ethical implementation and governance as well as the respect for and protection of cultural diversity and has the potential to disrupt local and regional ethical standards and values']"
